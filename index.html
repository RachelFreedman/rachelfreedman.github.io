	<h2><img class="profile-pic" src="/assets/images/recent_headshot.jpg" alt="image of Rachel Freedman">I'm a researcher interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning and value alignment.</a></h2>
	<p>I graduated from Duke University in 2017 with an interdepartmental BA in "Artificial Intelligence Systems". As an undergraduate, I studied computer science, neuroscience and philosophy at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through the <a href="https://robertsonscholars.org/">Robertson Scholars Leadership Program</a>, and at Oxford University as a Registered Visiting Student. My undergraduate thesis was supervised by <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/#bio">Dr. Vince Conitzer</a>, and I am continuing to work the the <a href="http://moralai.cs.duke.edu/index.html">Duke Moral AI research group</a> on incorporating moral values into a kidney allocation algorithm.</p>
