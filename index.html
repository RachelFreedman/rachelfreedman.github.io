	<p>I am an AI PhD student at UC Berkeley, researching reinforcement learning, reward modeling and model misspecification with the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">Center for Human Compatible Artifical Intelligence</a> (CHAI) and advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/">Professor Stuart Russell</a>. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Duke University in 2017 with an interdepartmental BA in "Artificial Intelligence Systems". As an undergraduate, I studied computer science, neuroscience and philosophy at both Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through the <a href="https://robertsonscholars.org/">Robertson Scholars Leadership Program</a>, and at Oxford University as a Registered Visiting Student. My previous research involved incorporating moral values into a kidney exchange algorithm as part of the <a href="http://moralai.cs.duke.edu/index.html">Duke Moral AI</a> research group, supervised by <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/#bio">Professor Vince Conitzer</a>. I am very grateful to be supported by an EECS Excellence Award.</p>
