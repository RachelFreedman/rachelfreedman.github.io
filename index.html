	<p>I am an AI PhD student at UC Berkeley, working with the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">Center for Human Compatible Artifical Intelligence</a> (CHAI). I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Duke University in 2017 with an interdepartmental BA in "Artificial Intelligence Systems". As an undergraduate, I studied computer science, neuroscience and philosophy at both Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through the <a href="https://robertsonscholars.org/">Robertson Scholars Leadership Program</a>, and at Oxford University as a Registered Visiting Student. My previous research involved incorporating moral values into a kidney exchange algorithm as part of the <a href="http://moralai.cs.duke.edu/index.html">Duke Moral AI research group</a>, supervised by <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/#bio">Dr. Vince Conitzer</a>.</p>
